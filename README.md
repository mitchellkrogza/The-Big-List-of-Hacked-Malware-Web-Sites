Some of the sites on the list are purposefully planting malware on their sites and luring people to click links in emails or social links. Some sites are merely wordpress sites that have been hacked and could contain malware.

Unfortunately to protect the public I have decided to start posting each and every one I find in this list.

The list shows which files have been planted on your site so it makes it easier for you to look for them and clean your site.

Simply deleting those malware files is not enough you have to find out from an expert how they got into your web site in the first place because if you do not fix that problem they will be back and you also have no idea what else they have planted inside directories or sub-directories on your web site.
